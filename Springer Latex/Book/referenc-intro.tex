%\biblstarthook{In view of the parallel print and (chapter-wise) online publication of your book at \url{www.springerlink.com} it has been decided that -- as a genreral rule --  references should be sorted chapter-wise and placed at the end of the individual chapters. However, upon agreement with your contact at Springer you may list your references in a single seperate chapter at the end of your book. Deactivate the class option \texttt{sectrefs} and the \texttt{thebibliography} environment will be put out as a chapter of its own.\\\indent
%References may be \textit{cited} in the text either by number (preferred) or by author/year.\footnote{Make sure that all references from the list are cited in the text. Those not cited should be moved to a separate \textit{Further Reading} section or chapter.} The reference list should ideally be \textit{sorted} in alphabetical order -- even if reference numbers are used for the their citation in the text. If there are several works by the same author, the following order should be used: 
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item all works by the author alone, ordered chronologically by year of publication
%\item all works by the author with a coauthor, ordered alphabetically by coauthor
%\item all works by the author with several coauthors, ordered chronologically by year of publication.
%\end{enumerate}
%The \textit{styling} of references\footnote{Always use the standard abbreviation of a journal's name according to the ISSN \textit{List of Title Word Abbreviations}, see \url{http://www.issn.org/en/node/344}} depends on the subject of your book:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The \textit{two} recommended styles for references in books on \textit{mathematical, physical, statistical and computer sciences} are depicted in ~\cite{science-contrib, science-online, science-mono, science-journal, science-DOI} and ~\cite{phys-online, phys-mono, phys-journal, phys-DOI, phys-contrib}.
%\item Examples of the most commonly used reference style in books on \textit{Psychology, Social Sciences} are~\cite{psysoc-mono, psysoc-online,psysoc-journal, psysoc-contrib, psysoc-DOI}.
%\item Examples for references in books on \textit{Humanities, Linguistics, Philosophy} are~\cite{humlinphil-journal, humlinphil-contrib, humlinphil-mono, humlinphil-online, humlinphil-DOI}.
%\item Examples of the basic Springer style used in publications on a wide range of subjects such as \textit{Computer Science, Economics, Engineering, Geosciences, Life Sciences, Medicine, Biomedicine} are ~\cite{basic-contrib, basic-online, basic-journal, basic-DOI, basic-mono}. 
%\end{itemize}
