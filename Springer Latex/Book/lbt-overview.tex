\section{ETSI’s LBT Mechanisms}
\label{subsec:ETSI-LBT-overview}
In \cite{LBT-ETSI-2014}, ETSI describes a number of spectrum access requirements to facilitate spectrum sharing for wireless access systems in $5$ GHz frequency band. This subsections focuses on requirements related to LBT mechanisms by which an equipment or a device applies CCA before using the channel to avoid collisions. The first mechanism is Frame Based Equipment (FBE) which defines a fixed (not directly demand-driven) timing frame for channel access. The second mechanism is Load Based Equipment (LBE) which defines demand-driven timing frame.

\end{figure}

\subsection{FBE-based Mechanism}
\label{etsi-lbt:fbe}
FBE shall comply with the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item
	\textit{R1:} Before starting transmissions on an operating channel, the equipment shall perform a CCA check using Energy Detect (ED). The equipment shall observe the channel for the duration of the \textit{CCA observation time}. The operating channel shall be considered occupied if the energy level in the channel exceeds the \textit{threshold} corresponding to the power level.
	
	\item
	\textit{R2:}
	If the CCA procedure finds the channel clear, the equipment may transmit immediately and occupy the channel for a \textit{fixed time period}.
	
	\item
	\textit{R3:} If the CCA procedure finds the channel occupied, the equipment shall not transmit on that channel during the next fixed frame period.
	
	\item
	\textit{R4:} The total time during which an equipment has transmissions on a given channel without re-evaluating the availability of that channel is defined as the \textit{Channel Occupancy Time} (CoT).
	
	\item
	\textit{R5:} After occupying the channel for CoT, the equipment keeps silent and waits for a short time, namely \textit{Idle Period} (IP).
	
	\item
	\textit{R6:} Towards the end of the idle period, the equipment shall perform a new CCA procedure as described in R1 above.
	
	\item
	\textit{R7:} The equipment, upon correct reception of a packet which was intended for this equipment, can skip CCA and immediately proceed with the transmission of management and control frames, e.g., acknowledgment (ACK) and block ACK frames.
	
	\item
	\textit{R8:}
	A consecutive sequence of such transmissions by the equipment, without it performing a new CCA, shall not exceed the maximum CoT.
	
	\item
	\textit{R9:}
	CCA observation time shall be not less than $20$ $\mu$s.
	
	\item
	\textit{R10:} CoT shall be in the range from $1$ ms to $10$ ms.
	
	\item
	\textit{R11:}
	The minimum IP shall be at least $5$\% of CoT used by the equipment for the current fixed frame period.
	
\end{itemize}

A simplified flowchart and an illustrative of FBE are given in Figs. \ref{figs:FBE-flowchart} and \ref{figs:FBE-example}, respectively.

\subsection{LBE-based Mechanism}
\label{etsi-lbt:lbe}
LBE shall comply with the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item
	\textit{R1:} Before starting transmissions on an operating channel, the equipment shall perform a CCA check using ED. The equipment shall observe the channel for the duration of the \textit{CCA observation time}. The operating channel shall be considered occupied if the energy level in the channel exceeds the threshold corresponding to the power level.
	
	\item
	\textit{R2:}
	If the CCA procedure finds the channel clear, the equipment may transmit immediately on that channel.
	
	\item
	\textit{R3:}
	If the CCA procedure finds the channel occupied, it shall not transmit in that channel. The equipment shall perform an Extended CCA (ECCA) procedure in which the channel is observed for a random duration.
	
	\item
	\textit{R4:}
	If the ECCA procedure has determined the channel to be clear, the equipment may start transmissions on this channel.
	
	\item
	\textit{R5:}
	The total time that an equipment makes use of the channel (without performing CCA) is the \textit{maximum Channel Occupancy Time} (mCoT), after which the device shall perform a new CCA procedure as described in R1 above.
	
	\item
	\textit{R6:}
	The equipment, upon correct reception of a packet which was intended for this equipment, can skip CCA and immediately proceed with the transmission of management and control frames, e.g., ACK and block ACK frames.
	
	\item
	\textit{R7:}
	A consecutive sequence of transmissions by the equipment, without it performing a new CCA, shall not exceed mCoT.
	
	\item
	\textit{R8:}
	CCA observation time shall be not less than $20$ $\mu$s.
	
	\item
	\textit{R9:}
	The random duration in an ECCA procedure is $N \times$ (CCA observation time), where $N$ is randomly selected in the range $\{1,2,...,q\}$, $q \in \{4,5,...,32\}$ (declared by the manufacturer).
	
	\item
	\textit{R10:}
	mCoT should be less than $(13/32)\times q$ ms (mCoT is in the range from $1.625$ to $13$ ms).
	
\end{itemize}
