\abstract{This chapter provides a high-level overview of LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) networks and associated technologies to form a basis for discussion of the co-existence issues that exist for unlicensed LTE and Wi-Fi. Understanding the underlying architecture and protocols employed in LTE-A networks will provide readers a comparative framework to grasp how, and at what levels, LTE and Wi-Fi networks may interact and interfere with each other, and form a greater understanding of the challenges to be address in designing coexistence mechanisms. Specifically, this chapter will overview the LTE-A network, its capabilities and protocols, with specific emphasis on the physical layer and medium access sub-layers to illuminate specific sources of co-existence issues. Proposed changes which may be included in future LTE releases are discussed in the context of LTE/Wi-Fi coexistence.}


\section{System Overview}
\label{sys-overview}
The enhancements to the Long Term Evolution (LTE)/E-UTRAN to meet the requirements set out for fourth generation (4G) cellular networks are collectively known as LTE-A, and were formalized in 3GPP TR 36.913, releases 10 through 13 \cite{tr36913}.  LTE itself was a logical evolution from the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies used in previous generations to meet the increasing demands for higher data rates and improved quality of service. LTE meets these demands at the access level through improved spectral efficiency, using OFMDA and SC-FDMA for downlink and uplink, respectively, and improved mobility support and cell edge data rates through enhanced adaptive modulation and bandwidth selection and downlink spatial multiplexing support. To support these gains beyond the access layer, LTE transitioned to an all IP packet switched core network with the introduction of the evolved packet core, and a flattened network architecture of enhanced base stations called evolved NodeB's (eNB) which are interconnected via high-speed.  Combined, this allowed LTE networks to significantly increase user data rates and reduce control and user plane latency and connection set-up and handover times.  

\subsection{Network Architecture}
\label{net-arch}
The requirements to provide high data rates while supporting high-speed mobility requires the ability to set up and tear down user connections and manage inter-cell handoffs with as little latency as possible.  The hierarchical structure consisting of base stations or NodeB's connected to a central controller which had been used in past cellular networks requires additional hops in both data transmissions and hand off negotiation which introduce significant delay.  For many increasingly ubiquitous end-user applications, such as online gaming, the additional latency in connection set up and handover can impair quality of experience see by users.  

To meet these requirements, LTE adopted the flat architecture shown in Fig. \ref{figs:LTE-A-Network} and migrated the functions of radio network and medium access control to the evolved NodeBs (eNB) \cite{lte-3gpp}.  The global functions and connections to external networks are handled at a the evolved packet core (EPC in the the figure). The mobile management entity (MME) handles authentication, authorization and accounting functions, among others.  The packet data network gateway (P-GW) and serving gateway (S-GW) handle user data packet forwarding, filtering, and usage tracking, as well as acting as a mobility anchor for inter-eNB and inter-RAT handovers.

	\label{figs:LTE-A-Network}
\end{figure}

The distributed radio network and medium access control allows eNBs to quickly adapt to changing radio medium condition and user scheduling based on local information.  The low-latency X2 interface connections between eNBs allows for fast user handover, including forwarding of queued data for seamless user experience.  Additionally, with direct connections between neighboring cells, this architecture facilitates more effective multi-point transmission and reception coordination and inter-cell interference and load management, independent of conditions in other areas of the network.  

\subsection{Capabilities and Features}

While the gains made by LTE were significant, they fell short of the requirements set out for 4G networks by the International Telecommunications Union, specifically in the case of peak data rates, spectral efficiency, and cell edge performance \cite{itu-advanced}. Some important ITU requirements and achieved performance levels for LTE and LTE-A are highlighted in Table \ref{perf-table}

\end{table}

Among other innovations, in order to meet these requirements, LTE-A extends bandwidth scalability in LTE by adding carrier aggregation to increase bandwidth while maintaining backwards compatibility and enabling a higher bandwidth for providers who cannot support it in contiguous spectrum allotments.  LTE-A also expands MIMO/spatial multiplexing support up to 8x8 for DL and 4x4 for UL, adds coordinated multi-point operation and relay nodes to increase spectral efficiency and cell edge data rates, and improves heterogeneous network planning with the enhancement of support for small cells and relay nodes to increase area coverage with reduced power requirements.

\section{Channel Access Mechanisms}
\label{channel-access}
Having been designed for use on dedicated licensed spectrum allocations, LTE-A uses a centrally controlled and scheduled channel access mechanism which divides the  .  The dedicated channel allows the LTE-A eNB schedule its users in time and frequency with a minimum of delay and no need for

\subsection{LTE-A Medium Access Protocol}
\label{lte-mac}
Description of (high-level) MAC sub-layer protocol activities and results, reference 3GPP TR 36.321 \cite{tr36321}
Consider that the MAC layer is really not that important as some coexistence mechanism for the unlicensed channel will obviously need to be in place that will work in parallel to the MAC layer for controlling access to the licensed spectrum.


\subsection{LTE-A Physical Layer Protocol}
\label{lte-phy}
Description of both OFDMA and SC-FDMA, primarily researched/reference from 3GPP TR 36.201 \cite{tr36201}. Consider including figures of both UL/DL framing, showing, from the point of view of Wi-Fi, that interference will/would span many WiFi transmission attempts (increased BO time due to no free channel time to decrement BO counter, resulting in significant frame delay, but not necessarily drops, but retransmission from the higher layers will likely cause drops from the queue .. ..  )
