%\abstract*{Each chapter should be preceded by an abstract (10--15 lines long) that summarizes the content. The abstract will appear \textit{online} at \url{www.SpringerLink.com} and be available with unrestricted access. This allows unregistered users to read the abstract as a teaser for the complete chapter. As a general rule the abstracts will not appear in the printed version of your book unless it is the style of your particular book or that of the series to which your book belongs.
%Please use the 'starred' version of the new Springer \texttt{abstract} command for typesetting the text of the online abstracts (cf. source file of this chapter template \texttt{abstract}) and include them with the source files of your manuscript. Use the plain \texttt{abstract} command if the abstract is also to appear in the printed version of the book.}

\abstract{This chapter provides a high-level description of LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) networks and associated technologies to form a basis for discussion of the co-existence issues that exist for unlicensed LTE and Wi-Fi. Understanding the underlying architecture and protocols employed in LTE-A networks will provide readers a comparative framework to grasp how, and at what levels, LTE and Wi-Fi networks may interact and interfere with each other, and form a greater understanding of the challenges to be address in designing coexistence mechanisms. Specifically, this chapter will overview the LTE-A network, its capabilities and protocols, with specific emphasis on the physical layer and medium access sub-layers to illuminate specific sources of co-existence issues. Proposed changes which may be included in future LTE releases are discussed in the context of LTE/Wi-Fi coexistence.}
